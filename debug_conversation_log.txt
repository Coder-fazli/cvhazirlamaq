AI REWRITER DEBUGGING CONVERSATION LOG
=======================================
Date: 2025-09-12
Issue: Server errors and API connectivity problems with AI rewriter website

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- User had AI rewriter website showing "Server xətası. Bir az sonra yenidən cəhd edin." error
- HTTP 500 errors in browser console when trying to use AI rewriter
- Multiple API key and connectivity issues discovered during debugging

DEBUGGING PROCESS:
==================

1. INITIAL ERROR ANALYSIS:
   - HTTP 500 errors visible in browser developer console
   - Server-side PHP errors in ai-api.php requests
   - Created debug.php script to identify server issues

2. API KEY CONFIGURATION ISSUES:
   - First API key was broken across multiple lines in config.php (syntax error)
   - Fixed by putting API key on single line
   - GitHub blocked push due to secret detection
   - Implemented secure solution: api_key.txt file (not tracked by git)

3. CURL HTTP/2 PROTOCOL ERROR:
   - OpenAI API calls failing with "HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: PROTOCOL_ERROR"
   - Fixed by forcing HTTP/1.1 in curl options: CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1
   - Added better error handling and timeouts

4. API KEY VALIDATION:
   - User created new API key (stored securely in api_key.txt)
   - Created test-api.php to validate API key - CONFIRMED WORKING (HTTP 200, models list retrieved)

5. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
   - Created test-rewriter.php to test full pipeline
   - All components loaded successfully (config, handler, instance creation)
   - Direct API call revealed the actual issue

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
===============
✅ API key is valid and working
✅ Server configuration is correct  
✅ PHP code is functioning properly
✅ CURL settings are optimized
✅ All files are properly deployed

❌ ACTUAL ISSUE: OpenAI quota exceeded (HTTP 429 error)
   Error: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"

SOLUTION:
=========
User needs to:
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
2. Add credits to OpenAI account or upgrade plan
3. Check usage at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage

Once credits are added, the AI rewriter will work immediately - no code changes needed.
